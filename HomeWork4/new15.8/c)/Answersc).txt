Question = Do
different choices give different shortest paths? Is some choice faster in finding the
minimum?

Answer: One of the most interesting thing or what make a significant difference was to decrease the rho. Since rho is a factor that decrease the pheromone level at every new 
round, it makes the pheromones decrease less fast and the shortest path found is found after more rounds than before. In the pheromone matrix plot, we can see more of a path 
of the pheromone level after a lot of rounds(150 rounds) which mirror the shortest path.

With a lower alpha we get a much more noisy behaviour of the shortest path length for every round. It shifts kind of chaotic.

There is not so much difference when tuning the beta.
