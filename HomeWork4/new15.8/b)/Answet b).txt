Question: . Do the ants explore the full graph, or is the search, in practice, restricted only to a
subset of the graph, especially after a few rounds? If the ants do not run over all the
possible paths, how can we be sure that we have effectively found the minimum?

Answer: From my plots I can see that the pheromones are kind of similar on all edges, like there is no cluster where there is particular more pheromones. That might have to do 
With that there is much more nodes that each ant can choose between than before.
Since there is more spread in the pheromones after all rounds than before (for instance N=40) there could be that there is a shorter path that never get found since the choice
of node at each step is based on the pheromone matrix. if the Pheromone matrix after some rounds converge to the shorthes path found, we probably have found the global optimum

Though I found that the above is based on a starting point and end point with a distance between them of around 100. When I run for the distance 40 between starting and end point
which is similar for the last run with N=40 where the distance where around 30. Well with N= 120 and a distance between starting and end point of 40 I get that it's found the 
shortest path really fast. That might have to do with that the relative distance is shorter, I mean that there is less edges to choose from when the N is bigger with the same
distance configuration between the starting and the end point. With this configuration I believe that we can be sure that the shorthest path has been found.

Comparing when I run for N=60 with the rest the same, I get comparing to N=120 and higher that it takes i little longer for it to find the shortest path.
