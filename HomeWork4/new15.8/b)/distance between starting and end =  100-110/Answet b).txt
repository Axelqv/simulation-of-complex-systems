Question: . Do the ants explore the full graph, or is the search, in practice, restricted only to a
subset of the graph, especially after a few rounds? If the ants do not run over all the
possible paths, how can we be sure that we have effectively found the minimum?

Answer: From my plots I can see that the pheromones are kind of similar on all edges, like there is no cluster where there is particular more pheromones. That might have to do 
With that there is much more nodes that each ant can choose between than before.
Since there is more spread in the pheromones after all rounds than before (for instance N=40) there could be that there is a shorter path that never get found since the choice
of node at each step is based on the pheromone matrix. if the Pheromone matrix after some rounds converge to the shorthes path found, we probably have found the global optimum
